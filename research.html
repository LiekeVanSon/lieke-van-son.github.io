								New observational facilities are probing astrophysical transients such as stellar explosions and gravitational wave sources at ever increasing redshifts, while also revealing new features in source property distributions. 
								To interpret these observations, we need to compare them to predictions from stellar population models.
								These models require the metallicity-dependent cosmic star formation history, S(Z, z), as an input, which is very difficult to constrain observationally, expecially at the high redshifts and low metallicities where it matters most!
								However, the advent of JWST observations promises high-redshift metallicity studies of previously unexplored regimes. 
								Both these large uncertainties and the anticipated new data call for a flexible function that can be easily updated when new information becomes available
								In this work, we propose a simple analytical function for the metallicity-dependent cosmic star formation history hat can be fit to the output of both cosmological simulations, and observational data constraints where available.
								We use this new model to investigate the effect of systematic variations in the S(Z, z) function on the predicted mass distribution of locally merging binary black holes.
								This allowed us to reveal that <p><i>the locations</i></p> of features are robust against variations of S(Z, z), and II) the low mass end is least affected by these variations. 
								This is promising as it increases our chances to constrain the physics that governs the formation of these objects.

							Gravitational-wave detectors are starting to reveal the redshift evolution of the binary black hole (BBH) merger rate. This rate could be a useful to trace star formation from a graviational wave perspective. However, in oder to achieve this, we need to know the delay time of mergers. However, delay times cannot be observed directly.
							In this work we find correlations between the delay time and the currently best measured observable: the black hole mass. 
							We distinguish two channels within isolated binary evolution and find that one channel (the `common envelope channel') produces low-mass binary black holes with short delay times (t delay ≲ 1 Gyr),
							while the other channel (the `stable channel') moslty forms high-mass binary black holes with long delay times (t delay ≳ 1 Gyr).
							This leads to the testable prediction that the redshift evolution of high-mass BBHs should be different than the evolution of low mass BBHs!

							The theory of pair-instability supernovae predicts a gap in the mass distribution of stellar mass black holes (BHs) between approximately 45 and 130 solar masses. 
							Can we create BHs with masses in this gap by allowing BHs to accrete mass from their stellar companion at a super-Eddington rate?

								Massive early-type galaxies follow a tight relation between the mass of their central supermassive black hole (\(M_{\rm BH}\)) and their stellar mass (\(M_{\star}\)).
								The origin of observed positive outliers from this relation with extremely high black hole mass (\( M_{BH} > 10^9 M_{\odot} \)) remains unclear. 
								We study such outliers in the Hydrangea/C-EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, designed to enable the study of high-mass galaxy formation and evolution in cluster environments.

							The inter and circum galactic medium (IGM & CGM) play a crucial role in understanding galaxy formation and evolution. One of the most common signatures found in quasar spectra is the strong Mg II absorption line doublet.		
							This study describes a statistical analysis of the abunance of cold gas traced by MgII absorbers by cross correlating the absorbers to quasars observed in radio in the BOOTES field of LOFAR, the NRAO VLA FIRST survey and the LARGESS survey.
